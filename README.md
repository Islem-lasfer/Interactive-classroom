# Interactive-classroom
Interactive Classroom is an AI-powered system that detects text from the whiteboard, records attendance, and transcribes the teacherâ€™s explanation. Using OCR and NLP, it automates note-taking, tracks student presence, and generates structured summaries, improving accessibility and engagement in modern classrooms.
